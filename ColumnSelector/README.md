## Bugs/Feature Requests
I accept pull requests and am responsive on GitHub, let me know!

## Hacking
Historically this was a .NET Framework Application, as time has progressed I have converted it to .NET Core. However it still uses Windows Forms for its UI. This means this is a Windows Only application until I can be bothered to use a Cross Platform UI Toolkit.
